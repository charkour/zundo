## Install

```sh
npm i zustand zundo
```

## First create a store with undo middleware

This returns the familiar store accessible by a hook! But now your store tracks past actions.

```tsx
import create, { UndoState } from 'zundo';

// define the store (typescript)
interface StoreState extends UndoState {
  bears: number;
  increasePopulation: () => void;
  removeAllBears: () => void;
}

// creates a store with undo/redo capability
const useStoreWithUndo = create<StoreState>((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}));
```

## Then bind your components

Use your store anywhere, including `undo`, `redo`, and `clear`!

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const { bears, increasePopulation, removeAllBears, undo, redo, clear } =
    useStoreWithUndo();

  return (
    <>
      bears: {bears}
      <button onClick={increasePopulation}>increase</button>
      <button onClick={removeAllBears}>remove</button>
      <button onClick={undo}>undo</button>
      <button onClick={redo}>redo</button>
      <button onClick={clear}>clear</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Alternatively, use the middleware

Instead of using `create` from `zundo`, use the `zundo` middleware and the `zustand` create.

```tsx
import { undoMiddleware, UndoState } from 'zundo';
import create from 'zustand';

const useStoreWithUndo = create<StoreState>(
  undoMiddleware((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
    removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  })),
);
```

### Middleware Options

```tsx
options: { exclude?: string[], include?: string[], allowUnchanged?: boolean, historyDepthLimit?: number }
```

#### **Exclude fields from being tracked in history**

Use the `exclude` option, which accepts an array of keys to not track. Alternatively you can use the `include` option which will result in only those keys being tracked.

_If for some reason you use both parameters, any key included in both will be excluded._

```tsx
// Only field1 and field2 will be tracked
const useStoreA = create<StoreState>(
  undoMiddleware(
    set => ({ ... }),
    { include: ['field1', 'field2'] }
  )
);

// Everything besides field1 and field2 will be tracked
const useStoreB = create<StoreState>(
  undoMiddleware(
    set => ({ ... }),
    { exclude: ['field1', 'field2'] }
  )
);
```

_Note: `exclude` replaces the option `omit` which will deprecated in future versions._

#### **Allow unchanged states to be stored**

Sometimes you may want to track states in history even if nothing has actually changed. Set `allowUnchanged` to be `true` to allow unchanged states to be stored. By default, it is `false` (well, technically it is `undefined`).

```tsx
const useStore = create<StoreState>(
  undoMiddleware(
    set => ({ ... }),
    { allowUnchanged: true }
  )
);
```

#### **Limit number of states stored**

For performance reasons, you may want to limit the number of previous and future states stored in history. Setting `historyDepthLimit` will limit the number of previous and future states stored in the `zundo` store. By default, no limit is set.

```tsx
const useStore = create<StoreState>(
  undoMiddleware(
    set => ({ ... }),
    { historyDepthLimit: 100 }
  )
);
```

## API

### `undoMiddleware(config: StateCreator<TState>)`

This is middleware for `zustand` which takes in a config for the store.

This works for multiple undoable stores in the same app.

### `create`

Create from `zundo` will return a store hook that has undo/redo capabilities. In addition to what fields are in the provided in your `StoreState`, the functions `undo`, `redo`, `clear`, and `getState` are added as well.

This works for multiple undoable stores in the same app.

- `undo`: call function to apply previous state (if there are previous states)
- `redo`: call function to apply future state (if there are future states). Future states are "previous previous states."
- `clear`: call function to remove all stored states from your undo store. _Warning:_ clearing cannot be undone.

Dispatching a new state will clear all of the future states.

### `createUndoStore()`

Will create a store that is used by the middleware to track the internal state of type `UndoStoreState`.

### `UndoState`

A type to extend when creating a global store with undo/redo capabilities.

```tsx
type UndoState = {
  // Will go back one state
  undo?: (() => void) | undefined;
  // Will go forward one state
  redo?: (() => void) | undefined;
  // Will clear
  clear?: (() => void) | undefined;
  getState?: (() => UndoStoreState) | undefined;
  // history is enabled by default
  setIsUndoHistoryEnabled?: ((isEnabled: boolean) => void) | undefined;
};
```

#### **Enable or Disable History**

Sometimes you may want to disable storing states in history, for example, when animating a point across the screen and you only want to store the beginning and end points in history. Use `setIsUndoHistoryEnabled`, returned from `useStore` to set programmatically set `true` or `false`.

#### Usage

```tsx
import create, { UndoState } from 'zundo';

interface StoreState extends UndoState {
  // fields
}

const useStoreWithUndo = create<StoreState>();
// (set, get, api)
```

#### **Cool-off period**

Sometimes multiple state changes might happen in a short amount of time and you only want to store one change in history. Use `coolOffDurationMs` to set how long (in millesconds) to stop new changes from being stored in history after an initial change has happened.

Please note: Even if you don't set `coolOffDurationMs`, if multiple state changes happen inside of the same frame (e.g. you called `setSomething` multiple times in the same function call), only one item will be stored in history.

### `UseStore`

It is an interface from `zustand` where `T` is your `StoreState`. Very similar to the type definition shown below. It is the type of any `useStore` hook. Used when passing the `useStore` hook as a prop.

```tsx
type UseStore<T extends object> = {
    (): T;
    <U>(selector: StateSelector<T, U>, equalityFn?: EqualityChecker<U> | undefined): U;
    setState: SetState<T>;
    getState: GetState<...>;
    subscribe: Subscribe<...>;
    destroy: Destroy;
}
```

### `UndoStoreState`

An interface for the store that tracks states.

```tsx
type UndoStoreState = {
  prevStates: any[];
  futureStates: any[];
  undo: () => void;
  redo: () => void;
  clear: () => void;
  setStore: Function;
  getStore: Function;
};
```

## Road Map

- possibly use better data structure for storing previous states. Maybe just a diff between states?
